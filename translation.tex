\chapter{Attempts at Translation}
In this chapter, we look at several attempts to connect the recurrences described in the introduction to the 
recurrences described in the application section.

As a first attempt, we consider a simple recurrence with an initial condition
\begin{align*}
T(0) &= 0 \\
T(n) &= 1 + T(n/2) 
\end{align*}
In order to make this fit the definition of an recurrence of the form $T(n) = a(n) + T(m(n))$, we may interpret $a$ as a 
piecewise function with two sub-functions: one for the general recurrence and one for the initial condition.
We can instead write this as a single recurrence
\begin{align*}
T(n) &= a(n) + T(m(n)) \\
m(n) &= n/2, \ \forall n \\ 
a(n) &=
\begin{cases} 
0, \ n = 0 \\
1, \ n \neq 0
\end{cases}
\end{align*} 
This recurrence can then by expressed in our chapter 2 syntax as 
\begin{align*}
\texttt{T} &= \texttt{rec}(\texttt{a},\texttt{m}) \\
\texttt{m} &= \lambda x.x/\texttt{2} \\
\texttt{a} &= \lambda x.\ifelse{x=\texttt{0}}{\texttt{0}}{\texttt{1}} \\
\llbracket \texttt{T} \rrbracket(d) &= \llbracket \texttt{rec}(\texttt{a},\texttt{m}) \rrbracket(d) \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\llbracket \texttt{a} \rrbracket(\llbracket \texttt{m}\rrbracket^i(d)) \\
&= \log n
\end{align*}

However, this approach will not work in every case. Let us try to use the same process on the following recurrence
\begin{align*}
T(1) &= 1 \\
T(n) &= 1 + T(n/2) 
\end{align*}
We first write this as a single recurrence. See that, unlike the previous example, $a$ is not a piecewise function---rather,
$a(n)$ always maps to $1$.
\begin{align*}
T(n) &= a(n) + T(m(n)) \\
m(n) &= n/2, \ \forall n \\ 
a(n) &= 1, \ \forall n
\end{align*}
We then express this recurrence using our chapter 2 syntax as
\begin{align*}
\texttt{T} &= \texttt{rec}(\texttt{a},\texttt{m}) \\
\texttt{m} &= \lambda x.x/\texttt{2} \\
\texttt{a} &= \texttt{1} \\
\llbracket \texttt{T} \rrbracket(d) &= \llbracket \texttt{rec}(\texttt{a},\texttt{m}) \rrbracket(d) \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\llbracket \texttt{a} \rrbracket(\llbracket \texttt{m}\rrbracket^i(d)) \\
&= \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}1 \\
&= \infty
\end{align*}
Which, clearly, is not a correct solution to this recurrence.
